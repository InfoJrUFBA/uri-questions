**Description:** Beatrice wants to invest her savings in a bank account that has a special kind of interest rate. Such interest rate is always compound, however it is variable, and it works based on the following rule: for months that are divisible by 4, the interest rate is 10%; for the other months, interest rate is 5% for even months, and 2.5% for odd months. Supposing the first month the interest rate isd going to take effect is always january, Beatrice needs your help to code a program which helps her find out how much money she'll have after a while if she invests x amount of money, and keeps the savings for y months in that bank account.

**Input:** For this challenge, the user is gonna input two positive numerical values, the former being the amount of money Beatrice is going to invest, and the latter being the amount of months she is going to wait until she finally withdraws her savings.

**Output**: The program must return a dollar sign, followed by the amount of money that will be avaliable for Beatrice to withdraw after the period of time that was given in the input. Always use a precision of 2 decimal places for the output, and round it up if needeed.

# Average Test Score

**Nome:** Average Test Score

**Description:** Read 3 values, in this case, variables A, B and C, which are the three grades of a student. Next, calculate the student's average score, knowing that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can range from 0 to 10.0, always to one decimal place.

**Input:**: The input file contains 3 values with one decimal place, double precision (double).

**Output:** Print the message "Final Score" and the student's average score as shown below, with 1 digit after the decimal point and with a blank space before and after the equality. As with all problems, don't forget to print the end of the line after the result, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error".
